## Overview
I am making scaled down version of risk, meant for quick 2 player strategy.  Every game will start out with 3 squares per person, plus 4 total neutral team squares. A dice roll will take place to determine who goes first.  Each turn will begin by selecting a square belonging to your team, after selecting a square you can choose to attack any adjacent enemy squares. Attacking a square will trigger a battle which will be determined by the amount of soliders in each sqaure, Attacking an enemy square until they have no soldiers will cause that square to belong to your team and change to your color.  Your current attackers will move into the defending square leaving behind one unit. The player who takes over all the squares on the board wins the game.

## Getting Around
From the start screen click "Take The Field", to start the game, and "Study Playbook" to open the directions screen.  While on the main game screen, click guide at any time to open the directions, (this will restart your current game). While on the "Playbook" screen, click "Break Huddle" at the bottom to return back to the game. 

## Directions
(Found in playbook on game)

## Starting new game
Every new game begins with a dice roll, click "Roll Dice" to get Roll values for both You and your opponent's team. The player with the highest roll value will go first. Pressing "New Game" at any time will restart your current game and return to the dice roll. If playing with the blue and green "Seahawk" territories, your turn will be displayed with "GO HAWKS!". If playing with the red and gold "49er" territories, your turn will be indicated with "GO NINERS!" Grey and red "Patriot" territories represent neutral players who can be attacked by either team.

## Adding 
Each turn begins with adding players to your field. To start adding players, click "Add Player", each team adds two new players per turn, the value shown on the "Add Player" button. Selecting one of your territories will highlight all the territories in which you can add players. Click on the territory where you would like to add players.


## Attacking 
After adding your 2 players to the board, its now time to attack! To start your attack, click "Attack". Next select the territory you would like to attack from. Your selected territory will be highlighted in Yellow. All adjacent enemies will be highlighted in dark green, click on any adjacent enemy to begin your attack. Attacking an enemy with fewer players will give you an edge during battle. You must have at least 2 players on your territory to attack an enemy, you can continue your attack as long as you have enough players.

## Ending Turn 
At any point during your turn you can select "End Turn", which will switch turns to your opponent and put you on the defensive.

## Winning conditions 
In order to win, you must control every territory on the field, both neutral and enemy. After game over, press "New Game" to start again
