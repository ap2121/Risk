## Overview
- I am making scaled down version of risk, meant for quick 2 player strategy.  Every game will start out with 3 squares per person, plus 4 total neutral team squares. A dice roll will take place to determine who goes first.  Each turn will begin by selecting a square belonging to your team, after selecting a square you can choose to either attack any adjacent squares or move soldiers from your current square to another square owned by your team. Attacking a square will trigger a battle which will be determined by the amount of soliders in each sqaure along with each players dice roll. Attacking an enemy square until they have no soldiers will cause that square to belong to your team and change to your color.  One soldier will be placed in that square.  The player who takes over all the squares on the board wins the game.
